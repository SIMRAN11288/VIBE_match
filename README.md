semantic search / Vibe matcher
Vibe Matcher is a mini AI recommendation prototype that connects user moods and aesthetics with fashion products.
By using text embeddings and cosine similarity, it matches a user’s vibe query (like “cozy minimalist winter” or “energetic urban chic”) to the most similar fashion items based on their descriptions.
